# Native Rust implementation of Apache Arrow

[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/arrow/rust/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/apache/arrow?branch=master)

Welcome to the implementation of Arrow, the popular in-memory columnar format, in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

This part of the Arrow project is divided in 4 main components:

| Crate        | Description                                                        | Documentation                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Arrow        | Core functionality (memory layout, arrays, low level computations) | [(README)](arrow/README.md)                                                           |
| Parquet      | Parquet support                                                    | [(README)](parquet/README.md)                                                         |
| Arrow-flight | Arrow data between processes                                       | [(README)](arrow-flight/README.md)                                                    |
| DataFusion   | In-memory query engine with SQL support                            | [(README)](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/master/README.md)          |
| Ballista     | Distributed query execution                                        | [(README)](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion/blob/master/ballista/README.md) |

Independently, they support a vast array of functionality for in-memory computations.

Together, they allow users to write an SQL query or a `DataFrame` (using the `datafusion` crate), run it against a parquet file (using the `parquet` crate), evaluate it in-memory using Arrow's columnar format (using the `arrow` crate), and send to another process (using the `arrow-flight` crate).

Generally speaking, the `arrow` crate offers functionality to develop code that uses Arrow arrays, and `datafusion` offers most operations typically found in SQL, including `join`s and window functions.

There are too many features to enumerate here, but some notable mentions:

- `Arrow` implements all formats in the specification except certain dictionaries
- `Arrow` supports SIMD operations to some of its vertical operations
- `DataFusion` supports `async` execution
- `DataFusion` supports user-defined functions, aggregates, and whole execution nodes

You can find more details about each crate in their respective READMEs.

## Arrow Rust Community

We use the official [ASF Slack](https://s.apache.org/slack-invite) for informal discussions and coordination. This is
a great place to meet other contributors and get guidance on where to contribute. Join us in the `arrow-rust` channel.

We use [ASF JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa) as the system of record for new features
and bug fixes and this plays a critical role in the release process.

For design discussions we generally collaborate on Google documents and file a JIRA linking to the document.

There is also a bi-weekly Rust-specific sync call for the Arrow Rust community. This is hosted on Google Meet
at https://meet.google.com/ctp-yujs-aee on alternate Wednesday's at 09:00 US/Pacific, 12:00 US/Eastern. During
US daylight savings time this corresponds to 16:00 UTC and at other times this is 17:00 UTC.

## Developer's guide to Arrow Rust

### How to compile

This is a standard cargo project with workspaces. To build it, you need to have `rust` and `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build
```

You can also use rust's official docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/arrow-rs -it rust /bin/bash -c "cd /arrow-rs && rustup component add rustfmt && cargo build"
```

The command above assumes that are in the root directory of the project, not in the same
directory as this README.md.

You can also compile specific workspaces:

```bash
cd arrow && cargo build
```

### Git Submodules

Before running tests and examples, it is necessary to set up the local development environment.

The tests rely on test data that is contained in git submodules.

To pull down this data run the following:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

This populates data in two git submodules:

- `../parquet_testing/data` (sourced from https://github.com/apache/parquet-testing.git)
- `../testing` (sourced from https://github.com/apache/arrow-testing)

By default, `cargo test` will look for these directories at their
standard location. The following environment variables can be used to override the location:

```bash
# Optionally specify a different location for test data
export PARQUET_TEST_DATA=$(cd ../parquet-testing/data; pwd)
export ARROW_TEST_DATA=$(cd ../testing/data; pwd)
```

From here on, this is a pure Rust project and `cargo` can be used to run tests, benchmarks, docs and examples as usual.

### Running the tests

Run tests using the Rust standard `cargo test` command:

```bash
# run all tests.
cargo test


# run only tests for the arrow crate
cargo test -p arrow
```

## Code Formatting

Our CI uses `rustfmt` to check code formatting. Before submitting a
PR be sure to run the following and check for lint issues:

```bash
cargo +stable fmt --all -- --check
```

## Clippy Lints

We recommend using `clippy` for checking lints during development. While we do not yet enforce `clippy` checks, we recommend not introducing new `clippy` errors or warnings.

Run the following to check for clippy lints.

```bash
cargo clippy
```

If you use Visual Studio Code with the `rust-analyzer` plugin, you can enable `clippy` to run each time you save a file. See https://users.rust-lang.org/t/how-to-use-clippy-in-vs-code-with-rust-analyzer/41881.

One of the concerns with `clippy` is that it often produces a lot of false positives, or that some recommendations may hurt readability. We do not have a policy of which lints are ignored, but if you disagree with a `clippy` lint, you may disable the lint and briefly justify it.

Search for `allow(clippy::` in the codebase to identify lints that are ignored/allowed. We currently prefer ignoring lints on the lowest unit possible.

- If you are introducing a line that returns a lint warning or error, you may disable the lint on that line.
- If you have several lints on a function or module, you may disable the lint on the function or module.
- If a lint is pervasive across multiple modules, you may disable it at the crate level.

## Git Pre-Commit Hook

We can use [git pre-commit hook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) to automate various kinds of git pre-commit checking/formatting.

Suppose you are in the root directory of the project.

First check if the file already exists:

```bash
ls -l .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

If the file already exists, to avoid mistakenly **overriding**, you MAY have to check
the link source or file content. Else if not exist, let's safely soft link [pre-commit.sh](pre-commit.sh) as file `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:

```bash
ln -s  ../../rust/pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

If sometimes you want to commit without checking, just run `git commit` with `--no-verify`:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "... commit message ..."
```
