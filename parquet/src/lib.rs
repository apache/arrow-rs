//! This crate contains the official Native Rust implementation of
//! [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/), part of
//! the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) project.
//! The crate provides a number of APIs to read and write Parquet files,
//! covering a range of use cases.
//!
//! Please see the [parquet crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/parquet)
//! page for feature flags and tips to improve performance.
//!
//! # Format Overview
//!
//! Parquet is a columnar format, which means that unlike row formats like [CSV], values are
//! iterated along columns instead of rows. Parquet is similar in spirit to [Arrow], but
//! focuses on storage efficiency whereas Arrow prioritizes compute efficiency.
//!
//! Parquet files are partitioned for scalability. Each file contains metadata,
//! along with zero or more "row groups", each row group containing one or
//! more columns. The APIs in this crate reflect this structure.
//!
//! Data in Parquet files is strongly typed and differentiates between logical
//! and physical types (see [`schema`]). In addition, Parquet files may contain
//! other metadata, such as statistics, which can be used to optimize reading
//! (see [`file::metadata`]).
//! For more details about the Parquet format itself, see the [Parquet spec]
//!
//! [Parquet spec]: https://github.com/apache/parquet-format/blob/master/README.md#file-format
//!
//! # APIs
//!
//! This crate exposes a number of APIs for different use-cases.
//!
//! ## Metadata and Schema
//!
//! The [`schema`] module provides APIs to work with Parquet schemas. The
//! [`file::metadata`] module provides APIs to work with Parquet metadata.
//!
//! ## Read/Write Arrow
//!
//! The [`arrow`] module allows reading and writing Parquet data to/from Arrow `RecordBatch`.
//! This makes for a simple and performant interface to parquet data, whilst allowing workloads
//! to leverage the wide range of data transforms provided by the [arrow] crate, and by the
//! ecosystem of libraries and services using [Arrow] as an interop format.
//!
//! ## Read/Write Arrow Async
//!
//! When the `async` feature is enabled, [`arrow::async_reader`] and [`arrow::async_writer`]
//! provide the ability to read and write [`arrow`] data asynchronously. Additionally, with the
//! `object_store` feature is enabled, [`ParquetObjectReader`](arrow::async_reader::ParquetObjectReader)
//! provides efficient integration with object storage services such as S3 via the [object_store]
//! crate, automatically optimizing IO based on any predicates or projections provided.
//!
//! ## Read/Write Parquet
//!
//! Workloads needing finer-grained control, or avoid a dependence on arrow,
//! can use the lower-level APIs in [`mod@file`]. These APIs expose the underlying parquet
//! data model, and therefore require knowledge of the underlying parquet format,
//! including the details of [Dremel] record shredding and [Logical Types]. Most workloads
//! should prefer the arrow interfaces.
