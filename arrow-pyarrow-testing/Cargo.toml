# Note this package is not published to crates.io, it is only used for testing
# the arrow-pyarrow crate in the arrow-rs repository.
#
# It is not part of the workspace so that `cargo test --all` does not require
# a Python interpreter or the pyarrow package to be installed.
#
# It is used to run tests that require a Python interpreter and the pyarrow
# package installed. It is not intended to be used as a library or a standalone
# application.
#
# It is different from `arrow-pyarrow-integration-testing` in that it works
# with a standard pyarrow installation, rather than building a dynamic library
# that can be loaded by Python (which requires additional configuraton of the
# Python environment).
