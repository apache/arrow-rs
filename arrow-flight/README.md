# Apache Arrow Flight

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/arrow-flight.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/arrow-flight)

See the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/arrow_flight/latest) for examples and the full API.

The API documentation for most recent, unreleased code is available [here](https://arrow.apache.org/rust/arrow_flight/index.html).

## Usage

Add this to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
arrow-flight = "51.0.0"
```

Apache Arrow Flight is a gRPC based protocol for exchanging Arrow data between processes. See the blog post [Introducing Apache Arrow Flight: A Framework for Fast Data Transport](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/) for more information.

This crate provides a Rust implementation of the
[Flight.proto](../format/Flight.proto) gRPC protocol and
[examples](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/tree/master/arrow-flight/examples)
that demonstrate how to build a Flight server implemented with [tonic](https://docs.rs/crate/tonic/latest).

## Feature Flags

- `flight-sql-experimental`: Enables experimental support for
  [Apache Arrow FlightSQL], a protocol for interacting with SQL databases.

## CLI

This crates offers a basic [Apache Arrow FlightSQL] command line interface.
