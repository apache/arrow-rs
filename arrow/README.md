# Apache Arrow Official Native Rust Implementation

[![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/arrow.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/arrow)

This crate contains the official Native Rust implementation of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) in memory format. Please see the API documents for additional details.

## Features

The arrow crate provides the following optional features:

- `csv` (default) - support for reading and writing Arrow arrays to/from csv files
- `ipc` (default) - support for the [arrow-flight]((https://crates.io/crates/arrow-flight) IPC and wire format
- `prettyprint` - support for formatting record batches as textual columns
- `js` - support for building arrow for WebAssembly / JavaScript
- `simd` - (_Requires Nightly Rust_) alternate optimized
  implementations of some [compute](https://github.com/apache/arrow/tree/master/rust/arrow/src/compute)
  kernels using explicit SIMD processor intrinsics.

## Building for WASM

In order to compile Arrow for Web Assembly (the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` WASM target), you will likely need to turn off this crate's default features and use the `js` feature.

```toml
[dependencies]
arrow = {version = "5.0" default-features = false, features = ["js"] }
```

## Examples

The examples folder shows how to construct some different types of Arrow
arrays, including dynamic arrays:

Examples can be run using the `cargo run --example` command. For example:

```bash
cargo run --example builders
cargo run --example dynamic_types
cargo run --example read_csv
```
