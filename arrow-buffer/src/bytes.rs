/// A continuous, fixed-size, immutable memory region that knows how to de-allocate itself.
/// This structs' API is inspired by the `bytes::Bytes`, but it is not limited to using rust's
/// global allocator nor u8 alignment.
///
/// In the most common case, this buffer is allocated using [`allocate_aligned`](crate::alloc::allocate_aligned)
/// and deallocated accordingly [`free_aligned`](crate::alloc::free_aligned).
///
/// When the region is allocated by a different allocator, [Deallocation::Custom], this calls the
/// custom deallocator to deallocate the region when it is no longer needed.
